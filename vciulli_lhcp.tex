\section{Introduction}

Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is the fundamental theory describing strong interactions among partons, \ie quarks and
gluons. Jets and photons production at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN are key processes to test predictions of
perturbative QCD (pQCD) over a wide region in phase space. They are also among the main backgrounds to new physics
searches and therefore needs to be measured with the highest possible precision to allow discovering the tinest
deviations between data and theory.

The LHC collaborations, ALICE~, ATLAS~\cite{Aad:2008zzm}, CMS~\cite{Chatrchyan:2008aa} and LHCb, performed
measurements of inclusive jet production, multi-jets production, jet properties and photon and diphoton production. 
In the following we will review most recent measurements.

\section{Jet Physics}

Jets are usually reconstructed with the anti-\kts algorithm~\cite{Cacciari:2008gp} with different values for the distance parameter $R$.
ATLAS uses topological clusters~\cite{Lampl:2008zz} of cells in the calorimeter as input objects. 
In CMS and LHCb, the particle-flow (PF) event algorithm~\cite{CMS:2009nxa}
first reconstructs and identifies each individual particle with an optimised
combination of information from the various elements of the detector. Next PF objects are used as input to the jet
reconstruction algorithm. ALICE uses both tracks and energy deposits in the
Electromagnetic Calorimeter to reconstruct jets in the region $|\eta|<0.9$.

The main experimental difficulties are the jet energy calibration and resolution estimate and the subtraction of pileup
effects. Additional proton-proton interactions (pileup) produce unwanted calorimetric energy depositions and additional
tracks. Different strategies have been developed to subtract these effect depending on the jet recontruction.

The results are usually compared to fixed-order predictions at NLO precision, complemented with electroweak corrections, and to predictions of
various Monte Carlo (MC) event generators that combine leading-order (LO) or next-leading-order (NLO) pQCD with the modeling of parton
showers (PS), hadronisation (HAD) and multiparton interactions (MPI).
Fixed-order parton-level calculations, to be compared with measurement, must be complemented with corrections for nonperturbative
(NP) effects that involve the modeling of HAD and MPI, which are obtained from MC programs. 

Inclusive jet production measurements have been perfomed with data collected at different centre-of-mass energies, ranging from 2.76 GeV to 13 TeV. 
Using 13 TeV data collected in 2015, the CMS experiment measured the double-differential inclusive jet
cross section as a function of the jet \pt and absolute jet rapidity $|y|$.\cite{Khachatryan:2016wdh}. The data samples correspond to
an integrated luminosity of 71\pbinv. During data collection the LHC operated with a $50\unit{ns}$ bunch spacing and the
average number of pileup interactions observed in these data is ${\approx}19$.   

Figure~\ref{fig:crossSection} shows the double-differential inclusive jet cross section measurements,
presented as a function of \pt for seven $|y|$ ranges, after
unfolding for detector effects, using the anti-\kts algorithm with $R =
0.7$ and $0.4$, respectively. The measurements are compared to the predictions from \POWHEG~\cite{Alioli:2010xa}
matched to \PYTHIAE~\cite{Sjostrand:2007gs} PS. The data are remarkably consistent with the predictions over a wide range of jet \pt from 114\GeV up to
2\TeV.

  \caption{Double-differential inclusive jet cross section as function of jet \pt at 13 TeV. Data (points) and
predictions from \POWHEG + \PYTHIAE with tune CUETM1 (line) are shown. Jets are clustered with the anti-\kts
algorithm with $R = 0.7$ (left) and $0.4$ (rigth).}
  \label{fig:crossSection}
\end{figure*}

Results are also compared to the \NLOJETPP~\cite{Nagy:2003tz} predictions using the CT14 PDF set~\cite{Dulat:2015mca}, corrected for NP and electroweak effects.
The ratios of data over the \NLOJETPP predictions are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ratio_CT14} for the rapidity region
$|y|<0.5$, but the same trend is observed in all the rapidity ranges. The relatively poor agreement for $R = 0.4$ might
be due to parton-shower and soft-gluon resummation contributions, which are missing in fixed-order calculations, or to
higher-order effects.

0.7 (left) and 0.4 (right). The error bars correspond to the statistical
uncertainties of the data and the shaded bands to the total experimental systematic uncertainties.}
  \label{fig:ratio_CT14}
\end{figure*}

The CMS collaboration has also recently made available new results for the double-differential inclusive jet cross section at 8
\TeV~\cite{CMS:2015haa} and 2.76 \TeV~\cite{Khachatryan:2015luy}. In the measurement at 8 \TeV, the ratio to the
cross section at 7 \TeV is also presented. A good agreement is observed in general between data and predictions, but for high
transverse momentum some discrepancies is present, in particular in the region $1.0 < \abs{y} < 1.5$, shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:ratio8to7}.

\begin{figure*}[hbpt]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{Figure3.pdf}
  \caption{Ratio of double-differential inclusive jet cross sections
    between $\mathrm{\sqrt{s}=8}$\TeV and $\mathrm{\sqrt{s}=7}$\TeV
    for rapidity bins $1.0 < |y| < 1.5$. In the top plots the yellow band shows the total
    experimental uncertainty, accounting for the correlation between
    different energies, and the theoretical prediction for the CT10
    PDF set is overlaid. The bottom plot shows the ratio of the measured
    cross section ratio to its theoretical prediction, with the
    experimental uncertainty shown as a full line band, and
    theoretical uncertainties as a shaded band.}
  \label{fig:ratio8to7}
\end{figure*}

Furthermore, the strong coupling constant \as is extracted from the measurement at 8 \TeV, using for the calculation the CT10 NLO PDF
set~\cite{Lai:2010vv}, which is found to provide the best agreement with data.
With the entire probed \pt range and six different rapidity bins, the best fitted value is found to be $\alpsmz =
0.1164^{+0.0060}_{-0.0043}$, which is compatible with the best current world average $\alpsmz =
0.1185\pm0.0006$~\cite{Agashe:2014kda}. The running of \asq, measured for nine different values of renormalization scale 
between 86\GeV and 1.5\TeV, is in good agreement with previous experiments and extends the measurement to the highest
values of the renormalization scale.

\end{figure*}

The ATLAS Collaboration has recently measured the strong coupling constant using the transverse energy-energy
correlation (TEEC) function and its associated azimuthal asymmetry in multi-jet events at a
centre-of-mass energy of 7 \TeV~\cite{ATLAS:2015yaa}. The average transverse momentum of the two leading jets is
required to be larger than 250 GeV. The TEEC distribution is obtained from the $\cos\Delta\phi_{ij}$ between any pair of
jets $i$ and $j$, weighted by $$w_{ij} = \frac{E_{Ti}E_{Tj}}{(\sum_k E_{Tk})^2} \, ,$$ where $E_T$ is the jet transverse
energy and the sum runs over all the
jets in the event. With respect to other observables the TEEC are less sensitive to the jet energy scale and resolution,
and to PU. The measured TEEC distribution is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:TEEC}, after unfolding for the effect of
the detector. In the same the result of a fit to pQCD NLO calculations from \NLOJETPP including NP
corrections is also shown. The measured value of \alpsmz is 
$$ \alpsmz  = 0.1173 \pm 0.0010 \mathrm{(exp.)} ^{+0.0063}_{-0.0020} \mathrm{(scale)} \pm 0.0017 \mathrm{(PDF)} \pm
0.0002 \mathrm{(NPC)} \, $$
and it is also in agreement with the world average. This value has been obtained with the CT10 NLO PDF set, which has
the largest PDF uncertainty, covering the variations with different PDF sets.

\begin{figure*}[hbpt]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{Figure5.pdf}
  \caption{The unfolded distributions for transverse energy-energy correlation compared with the results of a fit to
    pQCD NLO calculations including NP corrections. The green shaded band indicates the uncertainty on the
    theoretical predictions, which includes the sum in quadrature of uncertainties associated with scale, \as, PDF and
    NP corrections.}
  \label{fig:TEEC}
\end{figure*}

The ATLAS Collaboration recently studied 4-jets events at 8 \TeV\cite{Aad:2015nda}, exploring many variables sensitive to the topology and the
different energy scales of the event. These observables have been compared to predictions from several MC
generators and from fixed-order NLO calculations. The maximum rapidity difference among a jet pair, $\Delta
y_{2j}^{max}$, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:4jet}, is one of the variables where some discrepancies are observed. 
The NLO predictions, \BLACKHAT/\SHERPA~\cite{Berger:2008sj,Bern:2011ep} and
\NJET/\SHERPA~\cite{Badger:2012pg,Badger:2012pf}, are almost always compatible with the data within their 
theoretical uncertainties. The \HEJ~\cite{Andersen:2009nu,Andersen:2011hs} all-orders calculation and the multi-leg calculation with up to four partons in the
matrix element (ME) generated by \MADGRAPH~\cite{Alwall:2014hca} and matched to the \PYTHIAS~\cite{Sjostrand:2006za} PS also provides a good description of
the data. The $2\ \to 2$ MC generators \PYTHIAE and \HERWIGpp~\cite{Bahr:2008pv}
 describe the data relatively poorly. These results show therefore 
the importance of the more sophisticated calculations in a variety of scenarios.

    and HEJ predictions are multiplied by the factors indicated in the legend in order to be normalized to the events observed in the data. The left 
    panel shows the full spectra and the right panel the ratios of the different predictions to the data. The solid band represents the total experimental systematic

    propagation of the statistical uncertainties of the predictions and those of the unfolded data spectrum.} 
  \label{fig:4jet}
\end{figure*}

The CMS Collaboration has also recently published new studies of the properties of multi-jets events at 7\TeV~\cite{Khachatryan:2016udy, Khachatryan:2015xwa} and
8~\TeV~\cite{Khachatryan:2016hkr}. In Figure~\ref{fig:dijet} the azimuthal decorrelation $\dphi$ between the two jets with the largest transverse momenta at
8\TeV is presented for seven regions of leading jet transverse momentum \ptmax up to 2.2\TeV. The dijet azimuthal decorrelation is caused by
the radiation of additional jets and probes the dynamics of multi-jet production. The results are compared to calculations in
pQCD calculations from \NLOJETPP with the CT10 NLO PDF set for 3-jet production with up to four outgoing partons.
These fixed-order calculations provide NLO predictions for the range of
$2\pi/3 \leq \dphi < \pi$, corresponding to a final state with at least 3 jets, and LO predictions for $\pi/2 \leq \dphi <
2\pi/3$, where at least 4-jets must be present. The predictions are normalized separately in these two region and
describe the data well over several order of magnitude, though they increasingly deviate from data for lower values of
\dphi, especially at low \ptmax.

\end{figure}

In Figure~\ref{fig:dijet_ratios_MC_data} the ratio of several MC generators predictions to
the the data is shown. Similar conclusions as for the 4-jets analysis performed by ATLAS can be drawn. Event generators with only two outgoing
partons at matrix-element fail to describe the measurement. This apply also to \POWHEG that has NLO 
QCD corrections matched to the \PYTHIAE PS. In the case of \MADGRAPH+\PYTHIAS from two to four outgoing partons are
provided by the ME calculations and are matched to the PS, providing a very good description of the data down to very
low \dphi values.

  \label{fig:dijet_ratios_MC_data}
\end{figure*}

Jets are not only a probe for pQCD or other high trasverse momentum processes. They are also interesting for their
properties, which depends mostly on quark fragmentation and hadronisation. An example of this kind of studies is the
measurement of charged-particle multiplicity $<n_\mathrm{charge}>$ in jets performed by ATLAS on the 8~\TeV data sample\cite{Aad:2016oit}.
The multiplicity is measured including charged tracks with $\pt > 0.5$, 2 or 5~\GeV, for jets with $\pt > 50$~\GeV and up to
$1.5$~\TeV. Results are compared to \HERWIGpp, \PYTHIAS and \PYTHIAE with different underlying event tunings, showing
that the description of data improves for the most recent tunes. 
The charged multiplicity is important to discriminate between quarks- and gluon-initiated jets, being larger in the case
of a gluon jet. For this reason after unfolding the results for detector effects, the  $<n_\mathrm{charge}>$ is
extracted separately for quark and gluon jets as a function of the jet transverse momentum. Results are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:chargemult} and confirm that this number is larger for gluon jets as expected, with a dependence on the jet transverse
momentum.
